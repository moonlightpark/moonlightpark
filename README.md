## Hi there 👋


## 👋 Hi, I'm Byoungsoo (병수)

🔧 Senior Software Engineer | Blockchain Innovator | AI-Driven Product Builder

🚀 I'm a software engineer working between Seoul & Tokyo  
💡 I build AI tools, blockchain platforms, and EdTech apps  
🔧 I love Python, Docker, FastAPI, and decentralized systems  
🌱 Currently exploring distributed GPU platforms and mining dashboards

🛠️ Projects I'm working on:
- Open-WebUI with EVM wallet integration
- FastAPI reward API with JWT
- English learning app with TTS & pronunciation scoring
- Zeroth Blockchain Explorer → https://scan.zeroth.run
- I move fast, iterate faster, and believe great systems are built at the intersection of clarity, creativity, and code.
Whether launching infrastructure or a new idea, I’m always optimizing for scalability, user value, and long-term impact.
